## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to be deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   In your repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.
    *   Under "Build and deployment", select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
    *   GitHub will automatically detect the `deploy.yml` workflow file and suggest it.

That's it! Every time you push changes to your `main` branch, the GitHub Action will automatically build and deploy your application to GitHub Pages. You will be able to see your live site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`.
